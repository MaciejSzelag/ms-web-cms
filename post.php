                    <p>SEO stands for search engine optimization. At its core, SEO is the process of making your site rank as high as possible in Google when someone types in “burrito blanket” (or whatever it is you sell, promote, or talk about.) The higher your site ranks, the more visible your business is, and the more traffic and sales your business is likely to generate.If you are just getting started in SEO, though, you might be a little lost.</p>
                    <p>
                    There are tons of sites, books, guides (we even wrote one here at Search Engine Journal) – and you might find that most of those resources offer conflicting information.Part of the reason SEO frustrates so many people is that it changes continuously. Why? Because when marketers get their teeth into a new “strategy,” they like to run it into the ground. Essentially, we are why we can’t have nice things. Also, there’s the fact that Google is constantly updating its algorithm.
