                        <p>Websites usually differ from the functionality runnig in the back-end such as on a basic website to inform visitors about your brand, or on an eCommerce to sell your products and services and also, on a blog to publish your latest posts. Most websites I build have a combination of those functionalities running at the same time.</p>
